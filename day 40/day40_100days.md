### DAY 40 - DICTIONARIES
We have been using lists for a long time but there is an easier way of storing stuff and getting access without using index
In dictionaries we use keys so that items can be called

```python
dictionary = {"key":"value","name":"Clifford"}
print(dictionary[key])
```
All the values are seperated by a comma and the key and value by a semi-colon 
And you can just call them by using the key
