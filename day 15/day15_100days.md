### DAY 15 - While Loop

A while loop allows your code to repeat itself based on a condition you set.


In the code below, the variable is called counter and starts at zero. The while loop has the condition saying, "while the counter is less than ten do this..."

In this case, print the variable and then add +=1 to that variable. As long as variable is less than 10, the loop will repeat the code.

```Python
counter = 0
while counter < 10:
  print(counter)
  counter +=1
```
