### DAY 22 - LIBRARIES
Libraries are collections of code that have been written
The import function can be used to import a library
```Python
#Just call the name of the library by doing
import random
```
To generate a random number you can use the randint keyword with the random function
```Python
import random

randnum = random.randint(1,100)
print(randum)
```
This code will generate a random number between 1 and 100

### DAY 23 - CHALLENGE
Using the code from day 18 we are going to make it generate a random number instead of us setting it up ourself
