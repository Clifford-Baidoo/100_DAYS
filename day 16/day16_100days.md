### DAY 16 - ADDING TRUE TO WHILE LOOPS
While loops can be a lot of stress if not done write we would have to go throught the problem of infinite loops
The True value added makes it so that while loops become easier to handle

```Python
while True:
    Run this program
```

True is a boolean value 
A boolean can only have two values (True and False) 

The break function can be used to stop a loop once you use it
It jumps to the next unindented line in your code
```Python
while True:
  print("This program is running")
  goAgain = input("Go again?: ")
  if goAgain == "no":
    break
print("Aww, I was having a good time ðŸ˜­")
```
