### DAY 30 - FORMATTED STRINGS
Formatted strings are just an easier way to call strings either than putting them in commas
You can now add .format to the end and show it what parameters you want to put there

```Python
name = "Katie"
age = "28"
pronouns = "she/her"

print("This is {}, using {} pronouns, and is {} years old.".format(name, pronouns, age))
```
