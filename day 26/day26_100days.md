### DAY 26 - OS LIBRARY
The OS library allows us to communicate with the system directly
```Python
import os
for i in range(1,1000):
    print(i)

os.system("clear")
```

the time library also allows us to pause the execution of code for a certain time period
```Python
import time

time.sleep(2)
#Stops code from executing for two seconds
```
