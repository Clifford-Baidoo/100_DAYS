### Day 9 - Casting
Today we will be learning about Casting
Casting is basicallu changing the data type of the input we get
so something like changing a string to an integer and a float

Python can't use a string for an integer so if you use a string it is not going to work

An int is a whole number
A float is a number that has a decimal

```Python
myScore = int(input("Input your score: "))
if my_score > 1000:
    print("Winner")
else:
    print("Try again")

```
The int I put before the input will let python change the string to an integer
If removed the code will not run
